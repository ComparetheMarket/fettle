# Fettle

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/mdy537c3f6rjtlht/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oliwennell/fettle/branch/master) [![nuget](https://buildstats.info/nuget/Fettle.Console)](https://nuget.org/packages/Fettle.Console/)

Fettle is an experimental [mutation testing](https://github.com/ComparetheMarket/fettle/wiki/What-Is-Mutation-Testing) tool for C#.  

## Prerequisites

Fettle can mutate C# code that runs on the .NET Framework (Mono or .NET Core are not supported).  

If your tests use NUnit 3, Fettle will use them by default (version 3.10 or higher recommended).  

Or if you use another framework, or need to run them in a special way, then you can use a [custom test runner command](https://github.com/ComparetheMarket/fettle/wiki/Custom-Test-Runners).

## Getting Started

To start using Fettle, see the [getting started guide](https://github.com/ComparetheMarket/fettle/wiki/Getting-Started).  
To build from source, see the [developer guide](https://github.com/ComparetheMarket/fettle/wiki/Developer-Guide).

## Features

Fettle comes with some optimisations to make mutation testing faster:
* It will [perform test impact analysis](https://github.com/ComparetheMarket/fettle/wiki/Coverage-Analysis) on your project to try and find the subset of tests to run for a given piece of source-code.
* It can be configured to [only mutate your local changes](https://github.com/ComparetheMarket/fettle/wiki/Mutating-Modifications-Only) rather than your entire code-base.

## More Info

If you're having problems running Fettle see the [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/ComparetheMarket/fettle/wiki/Troubleshooting).
